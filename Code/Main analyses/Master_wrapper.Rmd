  to do:
DELETE 192!!!
Subject 54: noisy PPG -> remove
Subject 84: bad confidence ratings -> remove

  #from nicolas
  HRD - questions:
Subject 46: you said data was missing, but the HRD data is there - 44 and 45 is missing. 
Subject 27: rename file (28->27) - But in the intero data we both have, there are BOTH a subject 27 and 28. It doesn't seem to rename , wouldnøt we override some data that way?
Subject 74: missing data - No it's there???
Subject 81: incorrect file name (081) - but the data is there?? we have just removed the first 0 in 081.

HRD to do (aka to remove)
Subject 54: noisy PPG -> remove
Subject 84: bad confidence ratings -> remove

HBC - question: should we remove these data, if we don't use HBC in our analyses?
Subject 21, 31, 44, 45, 49, 50, 62: missing data?
